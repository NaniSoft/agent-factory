# AGENTS.md

Guidance for agents operating in this repository.

## What this repository is

`agent-factory` is the implementation of the agent factory described in
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md): a generic system that takes GitHub issues as use cases,
builds the change that answers them using code-server and OpenCode inside a fresh
container per issue, and merges the result back through a Kanban board where a
human reviews it. One issue in, one reviewed pull request out.

The public, reader-facing version of the design is published separately as the
Nexus documentation at https://nexus.nanisoft.com/docs. That is a publication
target, not a build dependency: this repository is the implementation of record.

## Commands

.NET 10. The solution is in [`src/`](src), and every command is run from the repository
root.

```bash
dotnet build src/agent-factory.slnx    # build the factory and its tests
dotnet test src/agent-factory.slnx     # run the whole suite
dotnet run --project src/agent-factory # run the factory; the board is on port 5000
```

The board is at <http://127.0.0.1:5000>. It is bound to loopback on purpose: the machine
is the trust boundary while the factory runs in development.

`dotnet test` starts the real factory in-process against a temporary `factories/`
directory and a temporary SQLite file, and asserts against what the board renders. There
are no sleeps in the suite and no shared state between tests.

## The factory

One process (`src/agent-factory`): the config loader, the work item store, and the board,
which is an ASP.NET Core endpoint the same process serves. See ADR-0003.

Three seams are the only things that leave the building; everything else runs for real:
`IClock` in `Clock/`, `INOpenCode` in `Rounds/` (one call is one round), and `IGitHub` in
`GitHub/` (one seam covering both polling and merging).

## The loop

`Loop/Orchestrator.cs` is the factory's state machine, hand-rolled and deterministic. It
moves work items Backlog → Frontier → In Progress → Review, and it is the whole of the
factory's policy. It references no container runtime: asking `INOpenCode` for a round and
receiving a result is all it knows, so the agent is faked in tests and no Docker appears.

One `Step()` applies at most one transition and never waits, which is what makes the
90-minute `FactoryConstants.RoundTimeout` a comparison against `IClock` rather than a
timer. `INOpenCode` has no production implementation yet, so the fake is registered in the
test host only, and the process serves the board without running the loop.

## Project files

A project is one file in [`factories/`](factories), and the served set is exactly the
files there — there is no registry to keep in step with the directory. The schema is
exactly these six values, and a field beyond them is **refused**, not ignored:

| Field | |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | the project's name, unique across the directory |
| `repo.url` | absolute http or https URL |
| `worker.image` | the image each round's worker container starts from |
| `llm.provider` | the LLM provider the agent runs on |
| `keys.github` | the **name** of an environment variable, never its value |
| `keys.llm` | the **name** of an environment variable, never its value |

A file that fails validation keeps its own project out of the rotation and is reported on
the board under "Project files refused"; the factory still starts. Shared, partial,
included and generated project files are all refused: a project is always exactly one
complete file that someone wrote.

Adding a project needs no code change and no rebuild, except that configuration loads at
start, so a changed file means a restart.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs live as GitHub issues in `NaniSoft/agent-factory`, driven with the `gh`
CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, used verbatim: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`,
`ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout: one `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See
`docs/agents/domain.md`.
